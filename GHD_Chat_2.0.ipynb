      "Analyzed Results: The document provides detailed information about pneumatic device emissions, including high-bleed pneumatic devices, and the calculation of CH4 and CO2 volumetric emissions from continuous high bleed, continuous low bleed, and intermittent bleed natural gas pneumatic devices using Equation W–1. It also mentions the emissions from blowdown vent stacks and the calculation of emissions from blowdown valves and isolation valves on compressors. Therefore, based on the information provided, the emissions from 100 high-bleed pneumatic devices can be calculated using Equation W–1 and the relevant calculation methods mentioned in the document. The equation W-1 describes the calculation of CH4 and CO2 volumetric emissions from pneumatic devices, and it involves factors such as the number of units and the emission factor. The emission factor for high continuous bleed pneumatic device vents is 37.3 in the Eastern U.S. and 1.39 in the Western U.S. Therefore, the emissions from 100 high-bleed pneumatic devices can be calculated by multiplying the number of units (100) with the emission factor (37.3 or 1.39) based on the location of the devices.\n"
